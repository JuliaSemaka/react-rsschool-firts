          Chalk fonts are fonts that simulate the writing on a chalkboard. If you want to create a chalk or crayon
          effect for chalkboard related graphics for schools, learning courses, educational websites, and posters, then
          a chalk font is most suitable to use. Chalk fonts and designs take on a vintage look, so you can consider
          chalk fonts as well for projects where a vintage feel is desired like postcards, wedding invitations.
          Depending on your projects, there are various styles of chalkboard fonts available such as serif, slab serif,
          hand-lettered, sketched, etc. For example, Lipstick designed by Canadian type designer Patrick Griffin is a
          typical chalk style font with a casual look. The designer got the idea from his wife’s note written in red
          lipstick. He first wanted to create a font simulating the lipstick writing but soon realized that the texture
          of lipstick writing has a lot in common with chalk writing. Finally, he created this font named “Lipstick”
          based on a 1970s film type called Sidewalk.

          uses Patrick Griffin’s Lipstikck font for the film title in the poster.
